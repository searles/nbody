# How to replace recursion

As long as the tree is not modified and does
not contain more than MAX_LONG nodes (which I guess
should be easily possible) every node can get a
unique address (remember, number of children not null
is fixed).



~~~
address = 0
node = root
countChildrenLeft = 0
countChildrenBelow = 0

while() {
    
}
